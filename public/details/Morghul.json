"History" : "During the Dance of the Dragons, Rhaenyra Targaryen and her blacks took King's Landing from Aegon II Targaryen and his greens. Morghul's owner, Princess Jaehaera Targaryen, was successfullly spirited away from the capital, however. Morgul stayed in the Dragonpit alongside Dreamfyre, Tyraxes, Shrykos, and Seasmoke (before he fled the city with his ridder, Ser Addam Velaryon) during Rhaenyra's half-year reign over the capital. Overtime Rhaenyra's relations with the citizens of the city deteriorated to the point of riots. In one of these riots a one-handed prophet called the Shepherd began to rant against the dragons and convinced the mob of Kingslanders to go to the Dragonpit and kill them all. Despite being shackled by heavy chains, Morghul slew scores of people with its fire. A huge man in heavy armor remember as the Burning Knight is credited for killing of Morghul. It is said he thrusted his spear through Morghul's eye as the dragon bathed him with fire. Morghul died never have been ridden."
