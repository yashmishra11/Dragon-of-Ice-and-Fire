"Description" : "Grey Ghost, or the Grey Ghost, was th,e name given by the smallfolk of Dragonstone to a wild dragon living on the island during the Dance of the Dragons, Grey Ghost preferred to feed on fish, and was often glimpsed flying low over the narrow sea, snatching prey from the waters. He made his lair in a smoking vent high on the eastern side of the Dragonmont. He was never claimed nor ridden by any man, and was one the three wild dragons of Dragonstone, along with Sheepstealer and the Cannibal.",

"History" : "During the Dance of the Dragons, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon sought new dragonriders to fight the greens. Some of the dragonseeds looked for the Grey Ghost, but could not find him, as he was ever an elusive creature. Alyn of Hull first sought out Grey Ghost before attempting (and failing) to claim Sheepstealer. In 130 AC, the crew of the Nessaria saw Grey Ghost and another dragon fighting in the sky above the Dragonmont. Grey Ghost was slain in the struggle. When Ser Robert Quince heard of Grey Ghost's death, he wrongly assumed this was the work of the Cannibal. In truth, Grey Ghost was vanquished and partially devoured by Sunfyre upon his return to Dragonstone."
