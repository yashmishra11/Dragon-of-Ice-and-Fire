"History" : "Jaenara flew Terrax further south into Sothoryos than anyone had ever gone before. The journey took her three years to complete, during which she found only jungle, mountains, and deserts, declaring Sothoryos to be “a land without end” and as large as Essos. Terrax is mentioned as one of the oldest dragons known in the ASOIAF universe, as Jaenara’s expedition occurred while the Valyrian Freehold was still standing strong.The Belaerys family went extinct in the Doom of Valyria or its aftermath."
